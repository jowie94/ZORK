## How to win [SPOILERS AHEAD!] 🔍
> All this steps can be done in any order, this is just a way to win the game.

First, pick up the **LaserGun** and equip it, once you have it head to the south, to the *First hall*. Now you have to go west, to the *Bedroom* and pick up the **IdCard**. Don't attack the **Feeder** and it won't attack you.

Now go east and return to the *First hall*, unlock the south door with the **IdCard** and go through it. Once in the *Second hall* go to east and enter the *Kitchen*, kill the **Slasher** and loot its body. Open the *Dinning room* with the **IdCard** and take the **ProtonGun** from the **Chest**. Equip both, the **ProtonShield** and the **ProtonGun**

Return to the *Second hall* and go south to the *Third hall*. Unlock the west door with the **IsaacCard** and go through it to the *Management room*. Here kill the **Headcrab**. Now return to the *Third hall* and go south to the *Bathroom*, kill the **Zombie** and loot its body.

Now return to the *Third hall*, go east to the *Emergency room*, unlock the east door with the **PodKey**, and go through it to the *Escape pod*.

If you have done it correctly, you'll be floating in the space and you'll have won the game!
